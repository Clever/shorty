# Pretty Self-Hosted URL Shortener

What, you need more information than the title?

Basically I looked around and found a bunch of toy examples of backend URL shorteners in Go, or PHP/MySQL solutions. I wanted to make something that spins up with super-simple configuration and has a pluggable backend. Please contribute!
